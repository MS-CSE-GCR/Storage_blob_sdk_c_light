# azure_storage_c_sdk_lite

The azure_storage_c_sdk_lite is a lite version of azure storage sdk in C language, allows you to build applications against [Microsoft Azure Blob Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/zh-cn/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-introduction). 
This sdk can be used in the embedded equipment for azure storage operation.

## About how to set up

1. clone the project using Git:

```
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/MS-CSE-GCR/azure_storage_c_sdk_lite.git
```

2. install the libraries following:

```
    //install cmake:
    sudo apt install cmake

    //install curl:
    sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev

    //install GnuTLSï¼š
    sudo apt-get install libgnutls28-dev

    //install gcrypt:
    sudo apt-get install libgcrypt11-dev

    //install fuse:
    sudo apt-get install libfuse-dev

    //install openssl:
    sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
```

3. build the SDK in release type:

```
    cd azure_storage_c_sdk_lite
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    make
```

4. run the sample code

You will have two ways to do the credentials. One of it is "[shared credentials](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/Authentication-for-the-Azure-Storage-Services)" which will need the "account name" and the "account key", the other way is "[shared access signature](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-dotnet-shared-access-signature-part-1)" which will need a sas token to do the credential. You need to input the information in the sample.cpp before run it.

```
    //Copy the libazure-storage.so to the /usr/lib  
    sudo cp libazure-storage.so /usr/lib  

    //Check the file size:
    du -sh libazure-storage.so

    //run the sample code:
    cd ../sample 
    make
    ./run 
```
